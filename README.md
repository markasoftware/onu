# Onu!

Play Onu: Easy to Learn, But Easy to Master! <sup>tm</sup>

If you want to play Onu, you're probably in the wrong place! This is for development and stuff. Officially hosted website will be added soon!

# Setting up a development environment

## Prerequisites

Install this stuff.

* Make (Yeah, the really old one. Gulp sucks. Yes, you too, grunt)
* Elm Platform (alright, alright, you only need `elm-make`, but just get the whole thing, will you?)
* Sass. i don't care what version of it you get, just something in your `$PATH`. It's not rocket science

## Building

Run `make`. That's easier than gulp, now isn't it? And you didn't even need node! And it won't build unmodified files!

## Playing

Just visit `public/index.html` in your browser of choice.
